## Overview:

The YouTube Channel Analysis project, built using R language, explores and analyzes the dataset of the most subscribed YouTube channels, collected by Nidula Elgiriyewithana from the Kaggle platform. The dataset provides valuable insights into channel performance, types, geographical distribution, and potential earnings.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the Global YouTube Statistics 2023, obtained from Kaggle:
